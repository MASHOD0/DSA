### Lab Programs 
#### Stack
- [Program 1: Write a program in C to simulate the working of a stack of integers using an array. Provide the following operations. a.
Insert b. Delete c. Display](https://github.com/MASHOD0/DSA/blob/main/LabPrograms/LabProg1/stack.c)
- [Application: In a calculator application, given an expression with parenthesis it is required to flag any parenthesis mismatch. Develop a program for this calculator application using
appropriate data structure.](https://github.com/MASHOD0/DSA/blob/main/LabPrograms/LabProg1/calculator.c)
#### Queue
- [Program 2: Design, develop and execute a program in C to simulate the working of a queue of integers using an array. Provide
the following operations. a. Insert b. Delete c. Display](https://github.com/MASHOD0/DSA/blob/main/LabPrograms/LabProg2/queue.c)
- [Application: In a system, resources are shared among multiple consumers for optimal performance. Considering jobs submitted to the printer have to be printed in the order of arrival. In print spooling, documents are loaded into a buffer and then the printer pulls them off the buffer at its own rate. Spooling also lets you place a number of print jobs on a queue instead of waiting for each one to finish before specifying the next one. Develop a program
for such scheduling using appropriate data structure.](https://github.com/MASHOD0/DSA/blob/main/LabPrograms/LabProg2/printer.c)

#### Singly linked list
- [Program 3: Design, develop and execute a program in C to perform the following operation on Singly linked list
a. Insert the node at a specific location
b. Delete a node at the beginning of the list
c. Display the list](https://github.com/MASHOD0/DSA/blob/main/LabPrograms/LabProg3/sll.c)
- [Application: Scientific applications involve many polynomials with varied degree. A polynomial is an expression consisting of variables and coefficients. Choose an appropriate data structure to represent the polynomial and perform addition of two
polynomials..](https://github.com/MASHOD0/DSA/blob/main/LabPrograms/LabProg3/polynomial.c)

#### Doubly linked list
- [Program 4: Design, develop and execute a program in C to implement a doubly linked list where each node consists of integers. The program should support the following operations:
a. Create a doubly linked list by adding each node at the front
b. Delete the node of a given data If it is found, otherwise display appropriate message
c. Display the contents of the list.](https://github.com/MASHOD0/DSA/blob/main/LabPrograms/LabProg4/dll.c)
- [Application: Colleges maintain the student’s records. As students enroll and graduate, the records have to be updated. It is necessary
to access the student’s data whenever required by college. Using suitable data structures develop a program for above scenario.](https://github.com/MASHOD0/DSA/blob/main/LabPrograms/LabProg4/students.c)

#### Binary Tree
- [Program 5: Design, develop and execute a program in C to create
a Binary tree using arrays and display the tree.](https://github.com/MASHOD0/DSA/blob/main/LabPrograms/labprog5/bt.c)
- [Application: Compilers use expression trees to represent mathematical expressions where the leaf nodes represent the operands and the internal nodes represent the operators. Develop a program to evaluate such an expression tree with non-negative
integers as operands and the arithmetic operators ‘+’, ‘-‘, ‘*’and ‘/’.](https://github.com/MASHOD0/DSA/blob/main/LabPrograms/labprog5/expression_tree.c)
#### Binary Search Tree
- [Program 6: Design, develop and execute a program in C to create
a Binary search tree and perform preorder traversals.](https://github.com/MASHOD0/DSA/blob/main/LabPrograms/labprog6/bst.c)
- [Application: In a payroll management system, it is required to store the employee data (Employee ID, Employee name, Login Time) as one logs in to the system. At the end of the day, it is required to generate a report of all the employee who logged in that day in ascending order of the Employee ID. Develop a
program to generate this report.](https://github.com/MASHOD0/DSA/blob/main/LabPrograms/labprog6/log.c)
